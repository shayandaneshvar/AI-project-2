QASs are search engines that can return a short and accurate answer for each question in natural languages.
The answer to the question that asked in such a system could be a document, a paragraph, a sentence, etc.
In this paper, an approach is proposed to optimize the performance of web-based QASs for answering questions in Persian.
Various features can be extracted from the text, through the ranking process.
Each of them examines the text from a perspective, but changes in the values of them are not consistent with each other.
therefore, it is needed to use a method that considers all these views.
In this regard, three different aspects (lexical, contextual and syntactical) of the text are considered.
Because evolutionary algorithms are appropriate for issues that have a large search space and texts can be analyzed from various aspects, the proposed approach uses NSGA-II as a Multi-Objective Evolutionary algorithm (MOEA).

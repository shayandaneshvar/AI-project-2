In recent years, Question Answering Systems (QASs) have been known as one of the most significant tools to access information.
In this paper, an approach is proposed to optimize the performance of web-based QASs for answering questions in Persian.
It has been considered a Persian Multi-Objective QAS that would achieve the most probable answer from the documents that has been retrieved by the standard search engine.
Various features can be extracted from the text, through the ranking process.
therefore, it is needed to use a method that considers all these views.
Because evolutionary algorithms are appropriate for issues that have a large search space and texts can be analyzed from various aspects, the proposed approach uses NSGA-II as a Multi-Objective Evolutionary algorithm (MOEA).
Comparing the obtained results from the proposed approach with other existing systems, reveals that it yields considerable and effective results.

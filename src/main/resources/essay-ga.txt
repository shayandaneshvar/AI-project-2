In recent years, Question Answering Systems (QASs) have been known as one of the most significant tools to access information.
QASs are search engines that can return a short and accurate answer for each question in natural languages.
In this paper, an approach is proposed to optimize the performance of web-based QASs for answering questions in Persian.
Because evolutionary algorithms are appropriate for issues that have a large search space and texts can be analyzed from various aspects, the proposed approach uses NSGA-II as a Multi-Objective Evolutionary algorithm (MOEA).
We have used a standard dataset and web data for assessing our system.
